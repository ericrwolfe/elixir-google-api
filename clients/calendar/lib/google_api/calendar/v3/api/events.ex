    - :showHiddenInvitations (boolean()): Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
    - :singleEvents (boolean()): Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
    - :syncToken (String.t): Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False. There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.  These are:  - iCalUID  - orderBy  - privateExtendedProperty  - q  - sharedExtendedProperty  - timeMin  - timeMax  - updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization. Optional. The default is to return all entries.
    - :timeMax (String.t): Upper bound (exclusive) for an event&#39;s start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored. If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.
    - :timeMin (String.t): Lower bound (inclusive) for an event&#39;s end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.
    - :timeZone (String.t): Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
    - :updatedMin (String.t): Lower bound for an event&#39;s last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.

  Updates an event. This method supports patch semantics.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.Calendar.V3.Connection): Connection to server
  - calendar_id (String.t): Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the \&quot;primary\&quot; keyword.
  - event_id (String.t): Event identifier.
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String.t): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String.t): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String.t): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String.t): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :prettyPrint (boolean()): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quotaUser (String.t): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :userIp (String.t): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :alwaysIncludeEmail (boolean()): Whether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.
    - :conferenceDataVersion (integer()): Version number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event&#39;s body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.
    - :maxAttendees (integer()): The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.
    - :sendNotifications (boolean()): Whether to send notifications about the event update (e.g. attendee&#39;s responses, title changes, etc.). Optional. The default is False.
    - :supportsAttachments (boolean()): Whether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.
    - :body (Event):

    - :alt (String.t): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String.t): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String.t): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

    - :prettyPrint (boolean()): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quotaUser (String.t): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :userIp (String.t): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :alwaysIncludeEmail (boolean()): Whether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.
    - :iCalUID (String.t): Specifies event ID in the iCalendar format to be included in the response. Optional.
    - :maxAttendees (integer()): The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.
    - :maxResults (integer()): Maximum number of events returned on one result page. The number of events in the resulting page may be less than this value, or none at all, even if there are more events matching the query. Incomplete pages can be detected by a non-empty nextPageToken field in the response. By default the value is 250 events. The page size can never be larger than 2500 events. Optional.
    - :orderBy (String.t): The order of the events returned in the result. Optional. The default is an unspecified, stable order.
    - :pageToken (String.t): Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.
    - :privateExtendedProperty ([String.t]): Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName&#x3D;value. Matches only private properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
    - :q (String.t): Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties. Optional.
    - :sharedExtendedProperty ([String.t]): Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName&#x3D;value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
    - :showDeleted (boolean()): Whether to include deleted events (with status equals \&quot;cancelled\&quot;) in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
    - :showHiddenInvitations (boolean()): Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
    - :singleEvents (boolean()): Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
    - :syncToken (String.t): Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False. There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.  These are:  - iCalUID  - orderBy  - privateExtendedProperty  - q  - sharedExtendedProperty  - timeMin  - timeMax  - updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization. Optional. The default is to return all entries.
    - :timeMax (String.t): Upper bound (exclusive) for an event&#39;s start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored. If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.
    - :timeMin (String.t): Lower bound (inclusive) for an event&#39;s end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.
    - :timeZone (String.t): Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
    - :updatedMin (String.t): Lower bound for an event&#39;s last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.
