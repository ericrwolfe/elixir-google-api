defmodule GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.MetricValue do
  @moduledoc """
  A metric value, with an expected value and a variance; represents a count that may be either exact or estimated (i.e. when sampled).

  ## Attributes

  - value (String): The expected value of the metric. Defaults to: `null`.
  - variance (String): The variance (i.e. square of the standard deviation) of the metric value. If value is exact, variance is 0. Can be used to calculate margin of error as a percentage of value, using the following formula, where Z is the standard constant that depends on the desired size of the confidence interval (e.g. for 90% confidence interval, use Z &#x3D; 1.645):    marginOfError &#x3D; 100 * Z * sqrt(variance) / value Defaults to: `null`.
