defmodule GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.Client do
  @moduledoc """
  A client resource represents a client buyer&amp;mdash;an agency, a brand, or an advertiser customer of the sponsor buyer. Users associated with the client buyer have restricted access to the Ad Exchange Marketplace and certain other sections of the Ad Exchange Buyer UI based on the role granted to the client buyer. All fields are required unless otherwise specified.

  ## Attributes

  - clientAccountId (String): The globally-unique numerical ID of the client. The value of this field is ignored in create and update operations. Defaults to: `null`.
  - clientName (String): Name used to represent this client to publishers. You may have multiple clients that map to the same entity, but for each client the combination of &#x60;clientName&#x60; and entity must be unique. You can specify this field as empty. Defaults to: `null`.
  - entityId (String): Numerical identifier of the client entity. The entity can be an advertiser, a brand, or an agency. This identifier is unique among all the entities with the same type.

A list of all known brands with their identifiers is available in the [brands.txt](https://storage.googleapis.com/adx-rtb-dictionaries/brands.txt) file.  A list of all known agencies with their identifiers is available in the [agencies.txt](https://storage.googleapis.com/adx-rtb-dictionaries/agencies.txt) file. Defaults to: `null`.
