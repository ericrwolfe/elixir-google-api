  The set of metrics that are measured in numbers of bids, representing how many bids with the specified dimension values were considered eligible at each stage of the bidding funnel;

  ## Attributes

  - bids (MetricValue): The number of bids that Ad Exchange received from the buyer. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bidsInAuction (MetricValue): The number of bids that were permitted to compete in the auction. Defaults to: `null`.
  - billedImpressions (MetricValue): The number of bids for which the buyer was billed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - impressionsWon (MetricValue): The number of bids that won an impression. Defaults to: `null`.
  - measurableImpressions (MetricValue): The number of bids for which the corresponding impression was measurable for viewability (as defined by Active View). Defaults to: `null`.
  - rowDimensions (RowDimensions): The values of all dimensions associated with metric values in this row. Defaults to: `null`.
  - viewableImpressions (MetricValue): The number of bids for which the corresponding impression was viewable (as defined by Active View). Defaults to: `null`.
