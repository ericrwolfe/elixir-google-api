defmodule GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.FilterSet do
  @moduledoc """
  A set of filters that is applied to a request for data. Within a filter set, an AND operation is performed across the filters represented by each field. An OR operation is performed across the filters represented by the multiple values of a repeated field. E.g. \&quot;format&#x3D;VIDEO AND deal_id&#x3D;12 AND (seller_network_id&#x3D;34 OR seller_network_id&#x3D;56)\&quot;

  ## Attributes

  - absoluteDateRange (AbsoluteDateRange): An absolute date range, defined by a start date and an end date. Interpreted relative to Pacific time zone. Defaults to: `null`.
  - buyerAccountId (String): The ID of the buyer account on which to filter; optional. Defaults to: `null`.
  - creativeId (String): The ID of the creative on which to filter; optional. Defaults to: `null`.
  - dealId (String): The ID of the deal on which to filter; optional. Defaults to: `null`.
  - environment (String): The environment on which to filter; optional. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [ENVIRONMENT_UNSPECIFIED, WEB, APP]
  - filterSetId (String): The ID of the filter set; unique within the account of the filter set owner. The value of this field is ignored in create operations. Defaults to: `null`.
  - format (String): The format on which to filter; optional. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [FORMAT_UNSPECIFIED, DISPLAY, VIDEO]
  - ownerAccountId (String): The account ID of the buyer who owns this filter set. The value of this field is ignored in create operations. Defaults to: `null`.
  - platforms (List[String]): The list of platforms on which to filter; may be empty. The filters represented by multiple platforms are ORed together (i.e. if non-empty, results must match any one of the platforms). Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - realtimeTimeRange (RealtimeTimeRange): An open-ended realtime time range, defined by the aggregation start timestamp. Defaults to: `null`.
  - relativeDateRange (RelativeDateRange): A relative date range, defined by an offset from today and a duration. Interpreted relative to Pacific time zone. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sellerNetworkIds (List[Integer]): The list of IDs of the seller (publisher) networks on which to filter; may be empty. The filters represented by multiple seller network IDs are ORed together (i.e. if non-empty, results must match any one of the publisher networks). See [seller-network-ids](https://developers.google.com/ad-exchange/rtb/downloads/seller-network-ids) file for the set of existing seller network IDs. Defaults to: `null`.
  - timeSeriesGranularity (String): The granularity of time intervals if a time series breakdown is desired; optional. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [TIME_SERIES_GRANULARITY_UNSPECIFIED, HOURLY, DAILY]
